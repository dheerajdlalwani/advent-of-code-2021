# Advent of Code 2021

- Hello everyone! This repository is about my solutions and experience with [Advent Of Code, 2021](https://adventofcode.com).
- Their [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) does a better job at explaining what it is. 
- I believe that it is a really good way of brushing up your problem solving skills, especially if you are a preparing for technical interviews or just love problem solvng in general.

    **I will be updating this README everyday with my experience/comments about the problems and concepts as well as keep the repository updated with the solutions for each with a delay of 1-2 days so that everyone gets a chance to attempt the problems on their own.**

    Day | Experience | Resources 
    :-: | :--------: | :-------: 
    01  | First day. Starting off with some pretty easy problems. Bringing in the sliding window concept in part two. | [GeeksForGeeks - Sliding Window Technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique) 
    02 | Second day having pretty easy problems too. Simple implementation - thats it. Nothing special. | - 
    03 | Sigh. So, I lost my enthusiasm and hence the long break. But I completed part 1 on time but finished part 2 quite late. I will try my best to catch up with the backlog. Used ArrayList and, particularly the removeIf methon to filter the elements. | [GeeksForGeeks - ArrayList removeIf() method in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arraylist-removeif-method-in-java)
