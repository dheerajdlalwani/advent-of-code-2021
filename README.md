# Advent of Code 2021

- Hello everyone! This repository is about my solutions and experience with [Advent Of Code, 2021](https://adventofcode.com).
- Their [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) does a better job at explaining what it is. 
- I believe that it is a really good way of brushing up your problem solving skills, especially if you are a preparing for technical interviews or just love problem solvng in general.

    **I will be adding a new markdown file everyday with my experience/comments about the problems and concepts as well as keep the repository updated with the solutions for each with a delay of 1-2 days so that everyone gets a chance to attempt the problems on their own.**
